It starts with assigning two asterisks to top 30 inactive/injured players (~ “stars”), and one asterisk to top 150 players (~ “starters”) for each game. No asterisks are given for 150+ players (~ “bench”). Fractional amounts are applied if they only are out for a portion of games. The rounds are then added together to get a cumulative tally."},{"type":"text","value":"Data for the reason behind a missed game are inconsistent. Typically, a value of “Did Not Play” refers to a deep bench player not getting minutes. For better players, it can just sometimes be used as a default value if they didn’t put a more specific reason. Therefore, Only DNPs for top 150 players count as missed games, while deep bench players require being listed as inactive or another specific reason to register as a missed game. This nuance only affects the opponent game by game charts, since only top 150 players are factored into the asterisk calculation. Additionally, non-injury related reasons are also included."},{"type":"text","value":"Introduction text is a parody of Five Thirty Eight’s <a href=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba/ target=_blank rel=no_referrer>RAPTOR blog.</a>"}]}
