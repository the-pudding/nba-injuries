		<h1>Introducing CRUTCH, Our New Metric For Asterisking NBA Champions</h1>
		<p>
			At The Pudding, we’ve been contemplating NBA (revisionist) history since
			2016. We started by redrafting the NBA, then looking at playoff carry
			jobs, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources.
		</p>
		<p>
			But that changes this year. CRUTCH, which stands for <strong>C</strong
			>hampionship <strong>R</strong>ating
			<strong>U</strong>tilizing <strong>T</strong>op
			<strong>C</strong>ompetitor
			<strong>H</strong>ealth, is The Pudding’s first (and last) NBA statistic.
			We’re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we
			bake in house, CRUTCH fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				First, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes
				advantage of a contrived acronym.
			</li>
			<li>
				Second, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that builds upon our other
				statistic, LIMP (League Injury Modified Performance).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			With so many injuries this year, we realized we needed to give fans more
			support when their team inevitably loses. Thanks to CRUTCH, you can now
			complain, with data.
